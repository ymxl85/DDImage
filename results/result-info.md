Results for the five research questions

# RQ1
* 1-suff-nec contains the lists of names of images for which BayLIME and SEDC produced sufficient and necessary explanations.
  DDImage always produced sufficient and necessary explanations, and thus the name lists are not presented for DDImage.
  
# RQ2
* 2-size: 12 .txt files for each of BayLIME and SEDC (both the size of all explanations, and the size of sufficient and necessary explanations);
  6 .txt files for DDImage
  
# RQ3
* 3-stability: 9 .txt files for each of the approach
*  A record consists of the name of the input image and the relevant similarity score.
  
# RQ4
* 4-time: 6 .txt files for each of the approach.
* A record reports the name of the input image and the time spent on producing the relevant explanation.

# RQ5
*5-segmentation reports the size and time information related of a newly configured DDImage (the kernel_size=4 is applied with quickshift)
